I'm an education and technology leader with native fluency in Spanish and English and advanced proficiency in French. I'm all about leadership development, customer success, education, and delivering professional development and workshop opportunities that educate and unite leaders, organizations, and communities.
Throughout my personal and professional experiences, I have gained and developed valuable insights and skills in a wide range of areas such as technology, customer success, education, training, event coordination, non-profit development and organization, data analysis, and marketing, among others.
As a 2013 Teach for America Corps Member I explored and deepened my passion for education and community involvement by serving as a Dual Language and Bilingual educator at low-income community schools. As a Multilingual Programs Specialist, I continued applying that passion as I coached and supported campuses and educators serving Emergent Bilinguals. My goal now, as a Success Manager, is to expand this work and reach even further, by providing high quality support to organizations, leaders, and partners nation-wide, so that they can continuously progress and be successful in their work. I strongly believe in the importance and impact of quality service, relationship building, and helping organizations and stakeholders achieve their full potential.

**My professional interests include:**

* Developing the right customer journeys and strategic action plans that drive value and satisfaction
* Automating and personalizing engagement, at scale
* Increasing adoption and expansion of impactful products and features
* Collaborate with team members to improve processes and efficiencies
* Build strong partnerships with key stakeholders to promote capacity and long-term imapct
